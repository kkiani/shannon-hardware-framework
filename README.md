# Shannon Smart Home Framework

The Shannon Smart Home Framework is a simple and flexible framework for creating smart home setups using the Arduino platform. This library provides classes for representing digital switches, sensors, and buttons, making it easy to add new devices and control them in your smart home.

## Getting Started

To use this library, you'll need to have the Arduino development environment installed on your computer. Once you have that installed, you can follow these steps to start using the Shannon Smart Home Framework:

1. Download the library as a ZIP file from this repository.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...
3. Select the downloaded ZIP file and click the "Open" button.
4. The library will now be installed and you can start using it in your sketches.

## Library Reference

The library consists of the following header files:

- `Button.h`: This header file provides the definition for the `Button` class. The Button class is used to represent buttons in your smart home setup.
- `Sensor.h`: This header file provides the definition for the `Sensor` class. The Sensor class is used to represent sensors in your smart home setup.
- `Switch.h`: This header file provides the definition for the `Switch` class. The Switch class is used to represent digital switches like smart power outlet switch in your smart home setup.
